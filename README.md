Bioinformatic Methods I

## BLAST
https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi

Program Query Database Alignment # Searches Uses
blastn DNA DNA DNA 1 find homologous DNA sequences
tblastx DNA DNA protein 36 find homologous proteins from unannotated
query and db sequences
blastx DNA protein protein 6 identify proteins in query DNA sequence
tblastn protein DNA protein 6 find homologous proteins in unannotated
DNA DB
blastp protein protein protein 1 find homologous proteins

## MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT

Global alignments are those in which the set of sequences to be aligned are similar across their
entire length
Local alignments are those in which there is similarity only at particular sub-regions of the
sequence.

## Selection Analysis

dN/dS Ratio Test
It is often useful to check your aligned DNA sequences using the TRANSEQ app of EMBOSS suite of tools from the EBI. Go to http://bar.utoronto.ca/EMBOSS
Datamonkey (http://www.datamonkey.org/) to look for selection in our sequences
